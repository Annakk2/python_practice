Contacts Manager - CLI App
 A simple contact manager built using Python.
You can add contacts, view them, and exit — all from your terminal.
This was one of my first real command-line interface (CLI) apps and helped me understand how programs take input and respond.

Why I Built This

To practice:

Python input/output
Lists and dictionaries
Control flow (if/else and loops)
Working with the command line
Writing clean, understandable code

Example Putput: 

What would you like to do? (A)dd, (V)iew, (Q)uit: a  
Enter contact name: Ana  
Enter phone number: 555-1234  
Contact added successfully.

What would you like to do? (A)dd, (V)iew, (Q)uit: v  
Your Contacts:  
Ana – 555-1234
